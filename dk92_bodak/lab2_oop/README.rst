+Python course: lab2 
=====================
*A module was created during the laboratory.*
==============================================
* ** Created seven classes. Figure as a main class and successor classes: Pawn, Rook, Horse, Elephant, Queen, King.**
* ** In the main class, the methods __str__ (displays information about the specification of a figure), __eq__ (compares the colors of figures), __gt__ (move a figure to the coordinates of another figure, conditional battle) are reassigned.** 
* ** For demonstration in the main, objects of figures are created and their functions are called.**
* ** There is no opportunity to play, only the basic implementation has been done.**
